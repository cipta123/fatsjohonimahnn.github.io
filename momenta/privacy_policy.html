	<h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
		
		<p>We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:

		<b>Account information.</b>  To create an account, you must provide a username and password. Your username is public, and it doesn’t have to be related to your real name. You may also provide an email address. We also store your user account preferences and settings.

		<b>Content you submit.</b>  We collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your actions/posts and momentum/comments including saved drafts, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages and group chats). Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos.

		<b>Actions you take.</b>  We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like supporting, saving, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as supporting, friending, and blocking. 

		<b>Other information.</b>  You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Momenta-sponsored activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.</p>

	<h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>

		<p>When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:

		<b>Log and usage data.</b>  We and 3rd party SDKs may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, hardware settings, IP address, and search terms.

		<b>Information collected from cookies and similar technologies.</b>  We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings.

		<b>Location information.</b>  We may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address.</p>

	<h3>Information Collected from Other Sources</h3>

		<p>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers, and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences here.</p>

		</ul>

	<h3>How Information About You Is Shared</h3>
		<p>When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users, 3rd parties, and the public. For example:
		<ul>
			<li>When you submit content (such as a post or comment or public chat) to the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content.</li>

			<li>When you send private messages or group chats, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content of your message, your username, and the date and time the message was sent. Keep in mind that additional users may be invited to join a chat after you send a message.</li>

			<li>When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments and how long you have been a member of the Services. </li>
		</ul>
		We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter).

		Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers.

		We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. The partner’s use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

		To comply with the law.  We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to government requests.

		We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.

		We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements, rules, or other Momenta policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.

		We may share information between and among Momenta, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.

		We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction.

		We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were.

		We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example:

		<b>Advertisers and Ad Networks</b>
		Our ad partners and ad networks may use cookies and related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Momenta does not link to or provide them with your actual Momenta account details. This means that Momenta does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Momenta cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers will not see Momenta cookies. 

		<b>Analytics Partners</b>
		We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.</p>

	<h3>What you can do</h3>
		<p>As a Momenta user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you.

		<h5>Accessing and Changing Your Information</h5>
		You can access and change certain information through the Services.

		<h5>Deleting Your Account</h5>
		You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account. 

		<h5>Controlling Linked Services’ Access to Your Account</h5>
		You can review the services you have linked to your account and revoke access to individual services here. 

		<h5>Controlling the Use of Cookies</h5>
		Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.

		<h5>Controlling Advertising and Analytics</h5>
		Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics here.

		<h5>Do Not Track</h5>
		Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.

		<h5>Controlling Promotional Communications</h5>
		You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.

		<h5>Controlling Mobile Notifications</h5>
		With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.

		<h5>Controlling Location Information</h5>
		If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.</p>

	<h3>Data Retention</h3>
		<p>We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.</p>

	<h3>International Data Transfers</h3>
		<p>We are based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.

		In connection with Momenta's processing of personal data received from the European Union and Switzerland, we adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Program (“Privacy Shield”) and comply with its framework and principles.

		Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share EU or Swiss data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing of EU or Swiss data in violation of the Privacy Shield principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

		For more information about the Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website.</p>

	<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
		<p>We may change this Privacy Policy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will provide you with additional notice through the email you provide us upon sign-up with Momenta. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. By continuing to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes go into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.</p>
